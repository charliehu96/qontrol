In preparation for future chip testing, this project is a custom GUI developed while familiarizing myself with the Qontrol Python API.  
The goal is to streamline testing by providing a more efficient and user-friendly way to control the Qontrol device once hardware becomes available.

- Control and monitor 60 individual channels
- Set and get current values per channel
- Global current control for all channels
- Functions window for current ramping, toggling, and live plotting
- Visual feedback for user actions (success and error handling)
- Responsive layout adapting to screen size

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyQt5

## Installation
```bash
pip install PyQt5
